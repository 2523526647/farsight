1. Make sure you have CMake installed

2. Make sure you have a compiler installed.  I use Microsoft Visual C++ (2005)
    You may need to make changes to your environment variables

3. Install required packages:

   Overview:

     To install VXL,ITK,and VTK, and Farsight first unzip source into folder like C:/VXL/src
     Run CMAKE making sure indicated parameters are correct
     Open the .sln file in Visual Studio
     Change to Release mode, and Build ALL, or Debug Mode if you want to use Debugging 


     To install libxml2, and QT use command line scripts described below
 

	1. VXL (latest)
		CMAKE w/ BRL,VIDL2,CONVERSIONS,EXAMPLES,EXPAT,VXL_DASH,GEL,OUL,OXL,PRIP,SHARED,
		TARGETJR,TBL,TESTING,UNMAINT,VGUI set to OFF

	
	2. ITK (latest)
		CMAKE w/ Shared,Testing,Examples,Doxygen set to OFF
		Set ITK_USE_SYSTEM_VXL to ON
    		See PYTHON.txt if you'd like to enable Python wrapping for ITK
	
	
	3. VTK (latest)
		CMAKE w/ Doc,Examples,Shared,Testing set to OFF
    		The embedded python shell needs VTK_USE_GUISUPPORT + VTK_USE_QVTK set to ON
    		See PYTHON.txt if you'd like to enable Python wrapping for VTK


	4. QT (latest)
		configure -platform win32-msvc2005
		nmake
	
	5. Farsight
		Examples,Testing,Shared set to OFF
		SET GUI TO ON IF DESIRED
		SET DESIRED MODULES TO ON, WILL TELL YOU IF MISSING LIBRARIES

		THE PACKAGE project does not build automatically, but can be selected and build.
		It requires some type of platform specific program for creating intall packages.
		Build PACKAGE to create an install file of Farsight.


4.  Running GUI:


	1. Try running Farsight.exe (in gui/release folder), may need to add to PATH environment variable.
    		Path should include binary directories of VTK,ITK,VXL,libxml2,QT,and VS2005
    		eg. for QT have C:/Qt/bin in PATH (DLLs are in here)

	2. Sometimes you may need to move some DLL to the directory where farsight.exe is, especially if you build in
		both debug and release modes
