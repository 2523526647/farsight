  <h1>Phase One Help</h1>
  <h2>Parameters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Vector Magnitude</b>: When an interpolated vector in the sub-voxel
      position has magnitude below this value, we take it as a critical point.
      Typical values range between 0.04 and 0.15.</li>
    <li><b>Morph Strength</b>: In graph morphological method with iteration
      of graph erosion and dilation steps, We set the morphology strength as the
      number of iterations for graph erosion and dilation.  Use higher values to
      remove longer branches.  Typical values range between 30 and 70.</li>
    <li><b>Edge Range</b>: If the distance between 2 points is above this 
      distance, we assume there is no edge between them in the graph structure
      before generating the IW-MST.  Use higher values for more connected
      graphs.  Typical values range between 1 and 15.</li>
    <li><b>Weight Factor</b>: Used to emphasize the function of either model
      description or the data description (tradeoff between coverage and
      conciseness).  Use higher values for more connected graphs.  Typical
      values range between 5 and 15.</li>
    <li><b>BSpline Order</b>: </li>
    <li><b>Number of Levels</b>: </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Integratedskel</b>: Extract the ridges and valleys from a 3D vector
      field</li>
    <li><b>BackboneExtract</b>: Extract dendrite backbone from a list of 3D
      points.</li>
    <li><b>SpineExtraction</b>: Generate graph structure from a list of 3D
      points.</li>
    <li><b>BSplineFitting</b>: Fit backbones to B-splines.</li>
    <li><b>RefiningSkeleton</b>: Form streamlines from saddle points and seed
      points.</li>
  </ul>
